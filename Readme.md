**This branch is in development but will include angular2**

This is a project exploring some of the best practices for using Grails and Angular together. It explores the balance between GSP side and Angular side rendering and how both can be used in harmony.

Here is a quick and dirty to get up and running (I will format later).

Ensure you have installed Node(NPM) and Grunt-CLI globally
Make sure you have installed all Grunt dependencies using 'npm install'
run grails run-app

If for any reason the pages don't show up try running grunt manually.

grunt min will minify
